            "Description": "Sales Engineering team was tasked with supporting high profile customers and assisting in pre-sale engagements.  I presented on topics related to SDN, solved problems for customers, designed POC architectures, presented at conferences, and wrote code to demonstrate the features of our product."

            "Description": "I wrote automation utilities, and assisted in the deployment and management of a 15000+ node physical cloud environment.  Among key accomplishments was writing a CMDB API and client library, writing utilities for cleaning up databases when systems were removed from the system, and managing our legacy production Jenkins environment which was used to pipeline the orchestration components that ran the cloud.  We made extensive use of Python, Chef, and Jenkins in this environment."

            "Description": "Cloudscaling was a San Francisco based startup focused on creating a productized version of OpenStack for enterprise customers.  Our product was unique in it's scalability and resiliency.  We contributed code back to the Open Source community when possible, but spent a large portion of our time focused on the product itself and the tools that helped created it.  Among my achievements here were the creation of an automated packaging deployment system for our build environment, chef integration with a custom key value pair database, and contributions to the front end of the web gui.  While here, I also was a Core Contributor for the Open Stack project on the python-openstackclient."

            "Description": "1 Month is a short stay at a job.  I left this in to demonstrate that NASA was committed to keeping me on board after Nebula was ended.  But, they really didn't have a place for me.  I spent a month hanging out at the National Advanced Super Computing Facility giving talks on virtualization related topics and answering questions for researchers about cloud / virtualization bottle necks.  I became bored, and felt like I was not contributing to NASA in a meaningful way, and felt that following the OpenStack project into the private sector might ultimately prove a more beneficial use of my time."

            "Description": "While at Ames I worked on the award winning Nebula project as one of two full time DevOps personel. We augmented a small development team. At that time, Nebula was focused on the creation of an open source elastic cloud solution called ’nova’. Later, Rackspace contributed their project ’swift’ and we together started the OpenStack project.  Today OpenStack is a major player in the elastic cloud space. The NSA, DreamHost, Rackspace, and several telecoms all operate large public clouds built on OpenStack.  Many more organizations such as CERN, NASA, and Verisign continue to utilize OpenStack in private cloud deployments.  While at Ames, I deployed the first production OpenStack clusters ever. We also worked on FISMA low and moderate certification for the cloud environment. Security was a high priority for NASA and our sprint planning reflected that. Today I am among a handful of people who have been using OpenStack since before it was OpenStack.  In addition to the ground breaking work we did on OpenStack we ran several Ganeti, and Eucalyptus clusters. Our clusters were used mostly for research related tasks in weather analysis, and mars exploration, however one cluster hosted USASpending.gov for the White House."
